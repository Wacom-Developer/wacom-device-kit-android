Wacom MotionDump Sample App

This sample app implements a simple logging application that dumps 
details about MotionEvents as they are reported.

The app provides details on the various axes reported by a device as 
they are updated in real-time. It may be used to get an idea of how to 
access these attributes, and what their values are on real hardware.
