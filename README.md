This repository contains the following sample code:

|Sample Code				|Description			|
|---						|---					|
|[Draw Simple](Draw%20Simple/README.md)				|Demonstrates how MotionEvent data may be used to implement a basic drawing application. It supports the choice of multiple brush colors, is sensitive to pen pressure, and allows different tools to have different brush properties.|
|[Motion Dump](Motion%20Dump/README.md)				|Dumps events received from all connected input devices (touchscreen, pen sensor, peripheral mouse, etc.) to the screen for review. Its code highlights the variety of events that can be received as well as the types of data that they contain. This may also be used as a debug tool to understand exactly what events an arbitrary Android app may receive from the hardware.|
